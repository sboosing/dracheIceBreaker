He was very uncomfortable because his lederhose was riding up.
But he wouldn't let anything slow him down on his way to his favorite Ratskeller.
He didn't have to worry about the lederhose ride because his klimaanlage kept everything breezy.
At the ratskeller they have a bierfarten in the back that is full of crazy porsches and gebaeck
He enjoyed his time at the ratskeller, but he had to leave early to go to the Flughafen.
He took the Hauptstrasse to the Flughafen in Berlin past the Biergarten.
er trank fünf biere und aß drei übersetzte bratwurst!
The porshe lived happily ever after.
You never know what you'll find off the hauptstrasse.

Rammstein always sounded best first thing in the morning. 
And smell the sweet aroma of the Gebaeck from Munich
You can always hear it during a full moon in any biergarten of Raesfeld.
However, lately, only a small hund has been able to hear the musik.  
The small hund likes to hangout in Berlin.
However, lately, only a small hund has been able to hear the musik. 
Along the hauptstrasse, women walked in dirndels down the street.
